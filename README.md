# AutoML Trading Strategy Research Platform

Personal research project for **systematic trading strategy discovery** on crypto markets.

The goal of this platform is not “just a bot”, but a full **research and AutoML pipeline**:
from data ingestion and backtesting to Bayesian optimization, scoring, portfolio construction, and (experimental) live trading.

> Focus: intraday / mid-frequency strategies on crypto (e.g. BTCUSDT), with realistic execution, risk management, and interpretable model-based search.

## 🗄️ Data Model

All persistent data is stored in **SQLite** databases:

- **Backtest DB**
  - `trades` — one row per trade (entry/exit timestamps, side, size, prices, fees, slippage, PnL, holding time…).
  - `logs` — time-series of step-level logs (indicators, signals, equity, reasons for entering / skipping trades…).
  - `kpi_by_backtest` — aggregated KPIs per backtest (Sharpe, Sortino, MDD, Ulcer, capacity flags, validity flags…).
  - `adaptive_decisions` — telemetry for adaptive thresholds and GP quality (WFCV metrics, N_soft/N_hard counts).
  - `market_data` — historical OHLCV (and optionally order book features) per symbol/timeframe.

- **Selection DBs**
  - `good_iterations.db` — pool of “SOFT-pass” strategies (consistency-first constraints).
  - `filtered_full_copy.db` — “HARD-pass” / showroom subset, used for portfolio and reporting.

The schema is **migration-friendly**: new columns or tables can be added without breaking existing data.

## 🤖 AutoML Pipeline

The AutoML loop works roughly as follows:

1. **Collect backtest results**
   - Run many backtests with random or GP-proposed hyperparameters.
   - Store logs, trades, and KPIs in SQLite.

2. **Filter and score**
   - Apply quality filters:
     - Minimal number of active days and daily volatility.
     - SOFT/HARD thresholds on key KPIs (Sharpe, MDD, % green days, Ulcer, concentration, capacity, etc.).
     - Outlier detection with a **Sharpe cap** and flags (`is_valid`, `flag_sharpe_outlier`).
   - Compute multi-criteria scores (percentile ranks + weighted score).

3. **Surrogate modeling & interpretability**
   - Train a surrogate model (e.g. gradient boosting) on `(hyperparameters → Sharpe capped)`.
   - Use **SHAP** to compute feature importances and understand which knobs matter.
   - Optionally embed SHAP vectors via UMAP for visual exploration (clusters, regimes).

4. **Gaussian Process & Bayesian Optimization**
   - Prepare a dataset for the GP (filtered strategies with valid KPIs).
   - Fit a **Gaussian Process** model and evaluate it with **walk-forward cross-validation** (time-ordered splits).
   - Use an acquisition function (Expected Improvement, etc.) plus a **trust-region**:
     - Explore around the best known strategies.
     - Adapt TR radius depending on recent improvement (shrink/expand).
     - Enforce diversity via distance constraints between candidates.

5. **Suggest new strategies**
   - Sample new hyperparameter sets from the GP+TR.
   - Feed them to the parallel backtest launcher.
   - Update databases, surrogate models, and thresholds.

6. **Stop condition**
   - Continue until a target number of GOOD strategies is reached (e.g. 100 SOFT-valid entries) or a max number of trials is hit.

## 🛡️ Risk & Execution Modeling

Risk management is implemented at multiple layers:

- **Per-trade**
  - Position size based on a **fixed % of capital at risk**.
  - TP/SL levels determined by volatility (ATR), support/resistance, and minimum profit margin.
  - Early-stop rules (max drawdown, max consecutive losses, max idle steps without trades).

- **Backtest level**
  - Rich KPI evaluation with Sharpe, drawdown metrics, Ulcer, VaR/CVaR, tail ratio, top-K day concentration, etc.
  - Flags for invalid or outlier strategies.

- **Portfolio level**
  - Correlation matrix between strategies.
  - Equal-weight portfolio optimized under max average correlation constraints and targeting consistent Sharpe.

- **Live runner**
  - Global risk manager (max % capital per position, max number of concurrent positions, daily gain/loss thresholds).
  - Telegram alerts on daily PnL thresholds and critical events.

## 📊 Dashboard

The **Streamlit dashboard** connects to the KPI SQLite database and provides:

- Filters on key metrics (Sharpe, Sortino, MDD, Win rate, % green days, Profit Factor, etc.).
- Sorted tables of candidate strategies.
- Detailed view for a given backtest ID (KPI JSON, potential links to logs/trades).
- Distribution plots and quick exploratory analysis.

This is the main tool to inspect and present the results to humans (including non-technical stakeholders).
